# Welcome to the GitHub of the MaD Lab!
The researchers in the Machine Learning and Data Analytics (MaD) lab conduct theoretical and applied research for wearable computing systems and machine learning algorithms for engineering applications at the intersection of sports and health care. Our motivation is generating a positive impact on human wellbeing, be it through increasing performance, maintaining health, improving rehabilitation, or monitoring disease.
